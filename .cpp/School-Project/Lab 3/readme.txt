Lab 3:
- The purpose of this lab is to create a Money class Object.
Define class object Money with the following characteristics:
   Private attribute:
  • int dollars;
  • int cents
 Define any Methods/functions/operators you need for this program.
 
 The class object should also have the following overloaded operators:

− Subtraction operator. If one Money object is subtracted from
another, the operator should give the difference between the
two Money. For example, if $8.150 is subtracted from $5.10, the
result will be $4.40.

+ Addition operator. If one Money object is added from another,
the operator should give the sum between the two Money. For
example, if $8.150 is added to $5.10, the result will be
$14.60.

* Multiplication operator. If one Money object is multiplying by x
the operator should return x * Money object.
For example, $5.10 * 2 will return $10.20.

== Equality operator. If one Money object is compared from
another (x == y), the operator should return true if x is same as
y. 


The output should look the picture provided on folder.
